# DesignPatterns
My favorite Design Patterns in both Ruby and Javascript!

## Strategy Pattern
- Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

## Observer Pattern 
- The observer pattern is a software design pattern in which an object, called the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods. 

## Decorator Pattern
- Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

## Factory Pattern
- A creational pattern that uses factory methods to deal with the problem of creating objects without having to specify the exact class of the object that will be created.
